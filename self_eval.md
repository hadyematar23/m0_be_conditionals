# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I felt like I understood the concepts but looked back at the "greater than" or "equal than" a lot because I forgot which one was which. Other than that, I undrestood it.  

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

Pretty good. Not confusing. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I also feel that I understand this. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

About an hour and a half. I was expecting this length of time. 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think the hardest part for some of it was understanding the prompts- the langauge and syntax used is the most new for me. I just think that it will take more time and practice and repetition to understand them. 


1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Did i understand the random number or string part in the spicy challenge correctly? Haha. I'm going to see if other people answered it and posted on loom or otherwise, ask my small group about it in the next Mod 0 meeting.
